# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to explore relationships between passenger features and survival outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features such as:
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Sex
- Age
- Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard (SibSp)
- Number of Parents/Children aboard (Parch)
- Port of Embarkation (Embarked)

## Features
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and inconsistent entries.
- Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.
- Machine Learning Models: DecisionTreeClassifier, XGBClassifier.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

## Key Learnings
- Explored relationships between features and target variable.
- Gained experience with Decision Trees and XGBoost.
- Learned model evaluation using accuracy and visualization of decision trees.
